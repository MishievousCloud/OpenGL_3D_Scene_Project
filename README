1. How do I approach designing software?
  *What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      The skills I gained in this project have let me understand the complexity of creating 3D elements in OpenGL and how to accomplish this.
  *What design process did you follow for your project work?
      I followed an iterative approach to this project as each week new features were being added into the project while remaining functional throughout each week.
  *How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      This approach is similar to that of an angile environment where weekly changes were introduced and required to be included in the project.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  *What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      No new approaches were used that differ from past works, but constant changes to the same code were done to both fix and improve the project each week.
  *How did iteration factor into your development?
      Each week a new feature was introduced and created in the project that added functionality and increased complexity of the whole project. Adding texture, adding multiple objects, adding lights, etc..
  *How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      Through my constant improvement in developing code, one fact is that commenting code has become more habitual 
      and I have been preparing my code for future changes by taking the time to make things easier the further into the project I go. 
      ex: making necessary changes now to improve effieciency in developement time later. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  *How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
      Learning how shaders reflect light off of objects, how textures are applied, and how lighting is imitated through code has expanded my knowledge and understanding of computer games drastically.
      This knowledge can be applied both in my educational pathway with game development by allowing me to understand the complexity of these effect and be able to recreate them.
  *How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      The skills learned here will be beneficial to my understanding of computers and how they work both in and out of game development.
